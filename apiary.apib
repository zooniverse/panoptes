# Panoptes API
Panoptes API is a *crowdsourcing system* based on serving _subjects_,
images or other media, to _volunteers_ and asking them to _classify_
the _subject_ based on a defined _workflow_ for the _subject_ type.

# Naming Conventions

Resources attributes related to human readable names for resources
follow a common convention.

+ name - the url_escaped, downcased, and underscored unique identifier that can be used to construct client URLs
+ display_name - a non-unique identifier that can contain any character. Used to quickly describe a resource.
+ title - a non-unique identifier that can contain any character. Maybe translated if a client requests a representation of a resource in another language

# Authentication
Panoptes API provides an OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism. (TODO:
Describe Authentication Workflow).

# Headers
Panoptes API sometime requires specific headers to be sent as part of requests.

All requests should set `Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=1`. You will receive a `404 Not Found` without it.

All PUT and POST requests should set `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json; version=1` or `Content-Type: application/json`. You will receive a `415 Unsupported Media Type` without one of those two headers.

All PUT and DELETE requests should set the `If-Match` header to the value of the `ETag` header of the request where the resource was originally retrieved. You will receive a `428 Precondition Required` without the header and a `412 Precondition Failed` if the etags do not match.

# Group Panoptes API Root [/]

# Group User
Resources related to _Panotpes Users_.

## User [/users/{id}]
A single User object. A User is representation of the identity and
contributions of a volunteer.

The User resource has the following attributes:

- id
- created_at
- updated_at
- credited_name
- login
- display_name
- email
- zooniverse_id
- classifications_count
- languages

*id*, *zooniverse_id*, *created_at*, *updated_at*, and
 *classification_count* are created and updated by the Panoptes API. `credited_name` is the publicly available name with which a volunteer will be credited on papers, posters, etc. When serialized, if an `@` character is found, the user's login will be returned instead for privacy reasons.

### List all classifications [GET]
Only lists classifications the active user has made or projects the user has edit permissions for.

Classifications have special collection routes that indicate the scope you would like to retrieve.

Possible options are:

+ '/' default, will fetch the current user's past complete classifications.
+ '/incomplete' will fetch the current user's past incomplete classifications.
+ '/project' will fetch classifications from projects a user has 'edit' permissions for
+ '/gold_standard' will fetch gold standard classifications for all marked workflows


Any of the scopes may be further filtered using the *project_id*, *workflow_id*
and *user_group_id* parameters.
+ Parameters
    + page (optional, integer) ... index of the collection page, 1 is default
    + page_size (optional, integer) ... number of items on a page. 20 is default
    + sort (optional, string) ... fields to sort collection by. updated_at is default
    + project_id (optional, integer) ... only retrieve classifications for a specific project
    + user_group_id (optional, integer) ... only retrieve classifications for a specific user group
    + include (optional, string) ... comma separated list of linked resources to return with the collection
    + last_id (optional, integer) ... only classifications with ids greater than `last_id` will be returned
                                      (`/project` only, requires project_id)

### Create a Classification [POST]
Create a classification by providing a JSON-API formatted object, that
must include _metadata_, _annotations_ and a _links_ hash. Optionally, it
may include the _completed_ field, which if not included defaults to true.
The completed field is used to store half-completed classifications, so the user
can later continue from where they stopped.

The _links_ hash must contain a _subjects_ hash, a _project_ and a _workflow_.
The _metadata_ hash must contain all the keys specified in the example.
Please note, the _workflow_version_ should be the value returned from the
specific workflow representation. The annotations array must be in the
format specified in the example, i.e. an array of objects, containing a _task_ and a _value_.
The _task_ can be anything and must not necessarily align with the tasks of the workflow
(even though that is generally not advised).

### Create a Subject [POST]
A *locations* attribute and a project link are required.

To have the Zooniverse host your media resources the *locations* array
should have the mime-types of the subject's associated media,
e.g `"locations":["image/png", "image/jpeg", "image/png"]`,
note the locations mime types are stored in order.

The create response will contain signed s3 urls the client may make a PUT
request containing the media to. The signed urls will be valid for 20 minutes.
Please take the order of the returned s3 urls into account when PUT'ing
local media resources to the remote location.

To use your own hosted media resources the *locations* array
should be comprised of objects that represent the mime-type and the hosted URL
of the subject's associated media,
e.g. `"locations":[
{"image/png": "https://your.s3_account.com/subjects/1.png"},
{"image/jpeg": "https://your.s3_account.com/subjects/1.jpg"}
]`.

The *metadata* attribute is optional.

# Group Workflows
Resources related to _Panoptes Workflows_.

## Workflow [/workflows/{id}{?include}]
Workflows represent the series of questions/tasks a user will be asked
to complete for a subject. Subjects are selected from SubjectSets. A
Workflow may have many SubjectSets linked to, but a SubjectSet may
only be linked to a single Workflow.

A workflow has the following attributes

- id
- created_at
- updated_at
- finished_at
- display_name
- tasks
- classifications_count
- pairwise
- grouped
- prioritized
- retirement
- retired_set_member_subjects_count
- active
- aggregation
- configuration
- completeness
- primary_language
- workflow_version
- content_language

*id*, *created_at*, *updated_at*, *workflow_version*, *content_language*,
and *classifications_count* are assigned by the API

*finished_at* is set by the API to a date/time when all subjects for this workflow have been retired.

Three parameters: _grouped_, _prioritized_, and _pairwise_ configure
how the api chooses subjects for classification. They are all false by default,
which will give a random selection of subjects from all subject\_sets that
are part of a workflow. _grouped_ enables selecting subjects from a specific
subject set. _prioritized_ ensures that users will see subjects in a
predetermined order. _pairwise_ will select two subjects at a tim for classification.

A workflow's `tasks` is a hash of keys to task definitions.

A workflow's `first_task` is a string matching the key of its first task. (The order of keys in JSON hashes is not guaranteed).

Each task has a `type` string of "single" or "multiple" choice, or "drawing". (More task types to come, e.g. Serengeti-style filter and Sunspotter's comparison.)

"multiple" and "drawing" tasks have a `next` string, linking to the next task in the workflow. If this string is empty, the workflow ends. In "single" tasks, each answer has a `next` string, allowing branching based on the user's decisions.

"single" and "multiple" tasks have a `question` string, which the user must answer. Answers to the question are in an `answers` array. Each answer has a `label` string displayed to the user.

"single" and "multiple" tasks may define a boolean `required`, which when true will force the user to provide an answer before moving on to the next task.

"drawing" tasks have an `instruction` string telling the user how to complete the task.

"drawing" tasks have a `tools` array.

Each tool has a `label` shown to the user.

Each tool has a string `type`. Options include:

+ point
+ ellipse
+ circle
+ line
+ rectangle
+ polygon

Each tool has a string `color`, which is applied to the marks made by the tool. Any format valid as CSS can be used.

    [Workflow Collection][]

### Create a Workflow [POST]
Requires a set of *tasks*, a *primary_language*, a *display_name*, and a
link to a *project*. Can optionally set cellect parameters *grouped*,
*prioritized*, and *pairwise* (all false by default) and links to
*subject_sets*.

A SubjectSet that already belongs to another workflow will be
duplicated when it is linked.

A Workflow may also include a _retirement_ object with a _criteria_
key and an _options_ key. _criteria_ describes the strategy Panoptes
will use to decide when to retire subjects while _options_ configures
the strategy. There are 2 valid criteria:
 1. `classification_count` will retire subjects after a target number
 of classifications are reached. You must supply an `options` hash
 with an integer `count` to specify the minimum number of classifications.
   + `{"criteria": "classification_count", "options": {"count": 15} }`
 2. `never_retire` will never retire subjects and requires an empty
 `options` hash.
   + `{"criteria": "never_retire "options": {} }`

If retirement is left blank Panoptes defaults to the `classification_count`
strategy with 15 classifications per subject.

A Workflow has a _configuration_ object that is used to store client configuration details.
Three attributes in this object are reserved: _training_set_ids_, _training_chances_ and _training_default_chance_,
_training_set_ids_ are used to choose training data from in the subject selectors
and to tell the counting systems which subjects to ignore as training subjects do not retire.
_training_default_chance_ is the fallback chance a user will see a training subject and also applies if _training_chances_ are not set
_training_chances_ are used to determine when to show a training subject and each index reflects a seen subject by the user.
E.g [ 1, 0.5, 0.1 ] reflects when i have seen 0 subjects (first element) on your workflow i will have a 100% chance of selecting a training subject.
After seeing 1 subject, I will have a 50% chance, on the second subject i will have a 10% chance, after that the default chance applies.

Normally when setting training subject selection you would set the retirement
config to "never_retire" and use another system (e.g. Caesar) to handle retirement.

# Group Membership
Resources related to _Panoptes Group Memberships_

## Membership [/memberships/{id}]
A membership represents and user's status in a group and their role
within the group.

It has the following attributes:

- id
- created_at
- updated_at
- state
- roles

*id*, *created_at*, and *update_at* are assigned by the API.

is added to a group, their state is set to "invited". After they take
action to join the group their state becomes "active". A User who leaves
a group has their state set to "inactive".

# Group SubjectQueue

This API resource was removed. Based on our logging, there was no usage of this API at all,
and it had been non-functional for a while (due to the SubjectQueue resources themselves not
being used for anything in Panoptes). Technically, we broke the API versioning here, but
because it started to have a significant maintenance cost, we feel this was good tradeoff
compared to maintaining it until API version 2.

# Group ProjectRole
