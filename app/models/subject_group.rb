# A SubjectGroup is a collection (cluster) of subjects that a user can classify
# They are generated by using the results of a user's subject selections
# and are stored in the database to enable the system to track what the user classifid on
#
# They have a special 'group_subject' that acts as the subject for use in the talk system
# as well as the existing API data model to enable the tracking of
# classifications, recents, seens data etc
#
# This class is not associated with the 'SubjectSet' class (a way to association subjects with a workflow)
